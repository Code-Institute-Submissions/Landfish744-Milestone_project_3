# Welcome to my Battleships Game!

This is a Code Institute portfolio project 3 based on python.

## About

The game of Battleships is well known. My game is a simple version of this game. Please enjoy!



## How to play

The has the rules explained when you start it up.

You choose the board size and the number of turns between 1 - 12.

You then play the game as you would normally play a game of battleships.

This is by choosing a column and a row.

The computer you are playing against will choose before you.

You will see the choices it makes as well as the choices you have made.

If you either run out of turns or the computer or you hit a ship , the game ends.

You can quit at any time by typing the word 'quit'.

## Testing

The testing was done at intervals during the build.

I tested this game in the terminal using 'python3 run.py'.

After the game was fully build and tested until it worked.

I also tested it on https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/ . 

This is a site that tests if the code is fully readable and presentable.

## Bugs I encountered

There was mainly I problem I ran into during my building of this game.

It was the quitting aspect of the game.

One of the builds the game gave an error message.

I restructered the code and this has now been fixed.

## Deployment

This project was deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal for Heroku.

The steps for deployment are as follows:

Fork or clone this repository

Create a new Heroku app

Set the buildpacks to Python and NodeJS in that order

Link the Heroku app to the repository

Click on Deploy

## Credits

This project uses the [Code Institute student template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) for deploying the third portfolio project, the Python command-line project.

The idea of using battleships is a suggested one by the Code Institute with "Ultimate Battleships" as inspiration.

I also took inspiration from the many Battleships walkthroughs from youtube or the web.

Thank you to my mentor Spencer who helped me with the finished code.
